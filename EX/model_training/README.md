# Fashion-MNIST Classification with CNN

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the basic workflow of machine learning using TensorFlow and Keras. The task involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing items.


## Dataset
The Fashion-MNIST dataset is utilized, loaded directly through TensorFlow's Keras API. It includes:

60,000 training images
10,000 testing images

## Model Accuracy
The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 89.08% on the test set, classifying 8,908 out of 10,000 images correctly.
